# Homely-bites-MERN-stack-project
One of the best projects I have developed is Homely Bites, a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). Homely Bites is an online food ordering platform designed to connect local home chefs with customers looking for homemade meals.
